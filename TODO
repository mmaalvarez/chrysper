Correct the moffat mess
	repeat NB loop for
		TKOv1_pooled
		RPE1 (now only Durocher's)
	load NBres
	remove old TKOv1_pooled and RPE1, and replace them with the new ones
		save NBres
	create the 2 tables of estimate-pval for TKOv1_pooles and RPE1
		save them
	load all tables and recreate table_fdr
		save it
	repeat manhattans
		maybe "fuse" them, add outline highlighting the labelled ones, so not 2 plots are needed
		maybe an extra manhattan only accounting for the brunello_pooled and tkov1_pooled

Draw hit curves (plot_model)

GO set enrichment of gene hits can provide more insights
