Change time contrasts from Linear-Quadratic (default) to Backward-difference, to look for "hockey-stick" trends: /Â¯ \_

	- example of how to set BACKWARD difference contrast matrices to use with time_cat in the regression

		contrast_matrix_three_levels_time_cat = matrix(c(-2/3, 1/3, 1/3,
		                                                 -1/3,-1/3, 2/3),
		                                               ncol = 2,
		                                               dimnames = list(c("time_0",
		                                                                 "time_mid",
		                                                                 "time_late"),
		                                                               c("mid-vs-zero", "late-vs-mid")))
		contrasts(eset$time_cat) <- contrast_matrix_three_levels_time_cat



Do a less stringent gen hit ascertainment:  it's not necessary that a hit replicates across cell lines
