add mageck non-essentials for offtarget


in nb loop, store only y


create table of genes (rows) and columns (samples) for each library. gather each. rbind. then create a 3rd col for estimate of time_cat.Q, and a 4th for its pval.

loop through nb list, doing the summary(y) and keeping the estimate and pval of time_cat.Q only, passing them to the 3rd and 4th cols in table

calculate fdr (qvalues). add to them the sign of the estimate (concave or convex). rm estimate and pval. pivot_wider, again rows genes and cols samples.


gene hit ascertainment
----------------------

FILTER: for each sign, FDR<|0.05| in time_cat.Q, overlapping across many control cell lines


downstream

Draw hit curves (plot_model)

GO set enrichment of gene hits can provide more insights
