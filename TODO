- Try with

	- different datasets

	- different sgRNA counts normalization approach

		- maybe use this set of nonessential genes for the NB offset, instead of the nontargeting grnas:
			/g/strcombio/fsupek_data/CRISPR/4_resources/genes_info/essentiality/core_sets/nonessential/mageck/mageck_nonessential_genes_count_normalization.txt

	- different condition level grouping

	- different condition interactions

	- different controlling factors

	- different regression models (mixed?)

	- different scope

		- currently the analyses are per-gene

			- detects the interaction of treatment*time WHEN ALSO inactivating a single gene

			- how do we define gene hits?

				- different filtering criteria

				- need descriptive plots for gene hits

		- could try also a single analysis with all genes

			- detects the interaction of treatment*time in the overall tumor

			- should maybe have gene essentiality as a correcting variable

				- demeter2:

					- shRNA-based (interference)

					- already added in test dataset, and there are commented lines to add it to other datasets in run_analysis.R ('D2_score')
				
				- achilles+pscore:

					- Cas9 sgRNA-based (KO)

					- use e.g. /g/strcombio/fsupek_data/CRISPR/4_resources/genes_info/essentiality/depmap/achilles_pscore/integrated_Sanger_Broad_essentiality_matrices_20201201/pscore_achilles_comb.tsv
						- or a more updated version, see README

					- then calculate the mean of 'crispr_score' as it was done in demeter2 with script /g/strcombio/fsupek_data/CRISPR/4_resources/genes_info/essentiality/depmap/demeter/mean_D2.R
